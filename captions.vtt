In this video I'm gonna explain the idea of composing functions.

2
00:04.480 --> 00:07.660
So if we have a function f, and another function g,

3
00:07.880 --> 00:10.230
so here I've chosen  x squared and cosine x,

4
00:10.230 --> 00:12.420
but you can change them in the sidebar

5
00:12.610 --> 00:15.380
we can form a new function by taking the output of f

6
00:15.410 --> 00:17.050
and using that as the input to g.

7
00:17.610 --> 00:19.560
So here's what the graph of that looks like.

8
00:20.270 --> 00:21.500
Let's step through this slowly.

9
00:22.170 --> 00:25.250
First we plug our x value into f, then we

10
00:25.250 --> 00:27.380
take the y value that f spit out

11
00:27.460 --> 00:29.320
and use that as the x value for g.

12
00:29.920 --> 00:31.930
And then whatever g spits out is

13
00:31.930 --> 00:34.170
the value of the composed function at x.

14
00:35.200 --> 00:37.620
The reason we're interested in this concept is that

15
00:37.650 --> 00:39.760
if we've got a complicated function and

16
00:39.760 --> 00:42.440
we can break it down as a composite of simpler functions,

17
00:42.850 --> 00:44.970
we can often understand something about the complicated

18
00:44.970 --> 00:47.670
function just by understanding it for each of the simpler

19
00:47.670 --> 00:49.790
functions individually, which is a lot easier.

20
00:50.380 --> 00:52.930
For example, in calculus we're interested

21
00:52.930 --> 00:57.250
in tangent lines to a curve. The chain rule says that

22
00:57.250 --> 00:59.660
the slope of the tangent line at a point on the

23
00:59.660 --> 01:03.440
composite  graph is the product of the slopes of

24
01:03.440 --> 01:05.680
the tangent lines at the corresponding points on

25
01:05.680 --> 01:08.190
the graphs of f and g, as you can see here.
